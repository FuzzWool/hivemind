	~ Loading is now more obvious.
	+ Better collision support. (independant of sprite)
	+ More robust Tile class.
	~ Easier to read, split into functionality.


~ Made PHYSICS adjustments.
	* Reduced x slowdown.
		- Nut may no longer scale a single wall.
	* Reduced vertical wall jump amount.
		- In a 4-block gap, Nut may only make 1-block progress
	* Increased jump amount.
		+ Nut may now cleanly jump over 2-tile platforms.

+ Add WALL HANG.

! slide > wall hang glitch (press l/r right before d)
! Holding both directional keys causes weird Nut walking.

! level_editor tools are generated for entities opted in


! check CONSIDERATIONS.
! update DESIGN GOALS.

DEMO RELEASE
========

! Add REPLAYS.
! Remake entity hierachy.

GOAL: Conserve RAM, speed up loading.


! Render Rooms only on-screen
