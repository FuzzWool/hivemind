Let there be Cool Moves
===========
Nut is born, and she has basic controls.
She can walk across slopes.

Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.
x Allow Nut to run across 1/2-block slopes.

x Add a DIVE.
x Add a WALL JUMP.
x Add CRAWLING.
x Add a SLIDE KICK.

~ Major refactoring for ROOM and WORLDMAP classes.
	+ Asset loading (tilesheets/collisions) done in advance.
	~ Loading is now more obvious.
	+ Better collision support. (independant of sprite)
	+ More robust Tile class.
	~ Easier to read, split into functionality.


~ Made PHYSICS adjustments.
	* Reduced x slowdown.
		- Nut may no longer scale a single wall.
	* Reduced vertical wall jump amount.
		- In a 4-block gap, Nut may only make 1-block progress
	* Increased jump amount.
		+ Nut may now cleanly jump over 2-tile platforms.

+ Add WALL HANG.
	* Nut must be completely overlapping a wall to hug.
	~ Dive is now a block movement.
	+ Add basic wall hang.
	+ Add crouching > wall hang combination.


+ Added DUST EFFECT.
	+ new axis_animation /w subclasses
	A bare class with fleshed out sub-classes.
		* Basic animation which starts and then stops.
		+ Bouncing sub-class.
		+ oscillate sub-class


	+ Dive - slamming the ground. Bigger effect if faster.
	+ Wall-jumping - trail in mid-air; hitting a surface.
	+ Walking - Greater effect depending on speed.


! Add DYNAMIC CAMERA.
! Add RUNNING animation.
! Add COLLECTIBLES which OPEN ROOMS.
! Add TIMER.
! Add REPLAYS.


! running glitch (over the end of a tile)
! Re-implement SLOPES. (They're broken!)
! clean overall state handling
! Use less MAGIC NUMBERS in state handling.
! Add PUNCHING.
! Holding both directional keys causes weird Nut walking.

====


! Add DYNAMIC CAMERA.

	+ Remake ToolBox.

		+ saving
		+ Tile
		+ ui tool selection
		+ Camera movement (not the tool)
		+ Pointer


	! Make Camera tool
		+ graphics (sides/locks)
		+ controls
		+ Room.Camera holds bools for each side.
		+ loading/saving values

		===
		GOAL: Fix lag. X
		GOAL: Load and unload to conserve RAM.

		+ Fixed Lag
			+ Make Room.Camera loaders into normal sprites
			+ limit draw iterations
				~ change WorldMap to a GameRectangle
			~ test with 30,30 rooms

		=

		~ Cleaned WorldMap > GameRectangle support
			tested with level editor, player_test
			! there are glitches, see docs below.

		~ Cleaned Room, Tile > GameRectangle
			tested with level editor, player test


		! GameRectangle
			! make keep_in_(insert)_bounds for abs,tile,room
			keep_in_(insert)_bounds inherits from...
				keep_in_x_bounds(x, x_bound)
				keep_in_y_bounds(y, y_bound)

			! make in_bounds for abs,tile,room
				in_x_bounds
				in_y_bounds


		! crashes to fix after
			! edge of level, x oob for next (player_test)
			! tile: placing off right,down

		! Room_Loader
		Loads sprites when they're in a room,
		unloads when they're not.
		Remembers prior and current camera.room_position
		====


		! Camera stops at enabled enabled sides.
		! Camera smoothly animates past enabled sides.

	! Render Rooms only when they may be drawn.

===

! CLEANING
	! level_editor camera controls go into toolbox

	! clean room and worldmap
		condense into classes

	! Improve GameRectangle
		setters
		keep_in functions
		...for every function.

		! bound_int (args: x,y or an object)
