Let there be Cool Moves
===========
Nut is born, and she has basic controls.
She can walk across slopes.

Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.
x Allow Nut to run across 1/2-block slopes.

x Add a DIVE.
x Add a WALL JUMP.
x Add CRAWLING.
x Add a SLIDE KICK.

	+ Asset loading (tilesheets/collisions) done in advance.
	~ Loading is now more obvious.
	+ Better collision support. (independant of sprite)
	+ More robust Tile class.
	~ Easier to read, split into functionality.


~ Made PHYSICS adjustments.
	* Reduced x slowdown.
		- Nut may no longer scale a single wall.
	* Reduced vertical wall jump amount.
		- In a 4-block gap, Nut may only make 1-block progress
	* Increased jump amount.
		+ Nut may now cleanly jump over 2-tile platforms.

+ Add WALL HANG.
	* Nut must be completely overlapping a wall to hug.
	~ Dive is now a block movement.
	+ Add basic wall hang.
	+ Add crouching > wall hang combination.


+ Added DUST EFFECT.
	+ new axis_animation /w subclasses
	A bare class with fleshed out sub-classes.
		* Basic animation which starts and then stops.
		+ Bouncing sub-class.
		+ oscillate sub-class


	+ Dive - slamming the ground. Bigger effect if faster.
