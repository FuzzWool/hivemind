Let there be Cool Moves
===========
Nut is born, and she has basic controls.
She can walk across slopes.

Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.
x Allow Nut to run across 1/2-block slopes.

x Add a DIVE.
x Add a WALL JUMP.
x Add CRAWLING.
x Add a SLIDE KICK.

~ Major refactoring for ROOM and WORLDMAP classes.
	+ Asset loading (tilesheets/collisions) done in advance.
	~ Loading is now more obvious.
	+ Better collision support. (independant of sprite)
	+ More robust Tile class.
	~ Easier to read, split into functionality.


~ Made PHYSICS adjustments.
	* Reduced x slowdown.
		- Nut may no longer scale a single wall.
	* Reduced vertical wall jump amount.
		- In a 4-block gap, Nut may only make 1-block progress
	* Increased jump amount.
		+ Nut may now cleanly jump over 2-tile platforms.

+ Add WALL HANG.
	* Nut must be completely overlapping a wall to hug.
	~ Dive is now a block movement.
	+ Add basic wall hang.
	+ Add crouching > wall hang combination.


+ Added DUST EFFECT.
	+ new axis_animation /w subclasses
	A bare class with fleshed out sub-classes.
		* Basic animation which starts and then stops.
		+ Bouncing sub-class.
		+ oscillate sub-class


	+ Dive - slamming the ground. Bigger effect if faster.
	+ Wall-jumping - trail in mid-air; hitting a surface.
	+ Walking - Greater effect depending on speed.


+ Added DYNAMIC CAMERA.

	+ Remade ToolBox.
	+ Made Camera tool
		+ Room.Camera holds bools for each side.
		+ loading/saving values

	+ Made GameCamera
		+ Camera stops at lock enabled sides of rooms.
		+ Camera animates past enabled sides.

		+ Animation - works out speed by frames wanted.
			+ Good glitch
			Smooths the camera by repeatedly lowering the speed.


! Add COLLECTIBLES which OPEN ROOMS.
! Add RUNNING animation.
! Add TIMER.
! Add REPLAYS.


! running glitch (over the end of a tile)
! crawling > ducking animation stuttering
! slide > wall hang glitch (press l/r right before d)
! Holding both directional keys causes weird Nut walking.

! Add SLOPES. (They're broken!)
! clean overall state handling
! Use less MAGIC NUMBERS in state handling.
! Add PUNCHING.


=====

! Add COLLECTIBLES which OPEN ROOMS.

	~ level_editor tools split into tools directory

	+ load entities
		* entities > entity_room > entity hierachy
		+ for each room there is a list of entities to load
		+ entities are loaded by name and position

	+ created an Entity TOOL.
		+ orb graphic follows cursor

		+ places down entities
		+ saves entities
		! remove entities

	+ render entities
		+ entities render when focused by the camera
		+ unrendered otherwise


	! editor - entity place/remove glitches
		! entities may logically be in other rooms,
		but are rendered in the same room
			~ entities have abs values, but save/load pro

			~ level editor fixed
			~ player test camera fixed


	+ tile_key
		+ graphic
		+ keys bop up and down
			~ fixed bounce and oscillate
		+ keys are "collected" on impact with Nut
	
	===
	
	! tile_lock and tile_key tools		
		+ use their own portrait
		+ individual tools

		PROBLEM:
		For every new entity, it needs a new tool.
		Making a new tool requires a lot of small core code changes peppered around the toolbox.

		Additionally, every new tool for each entity,
		unnecessarily creates a new entity tool for
		a new name.


		SOLUTION:
		! when new entities are added,
		they're automatically given a tool

			! read from the entities module,
			take class names
				! ignore "entity", "entities" and "entity_room"

			! logic: only 'name' changes in the entity tool




	! entity.react checks every single entity
	Limit the Player scope to nearby rooms


	! tile_lock
		+ graphic
		! removes the tile it is on top of.

	! tile_key > tile_lock
		each key has it's own lock
		on collection, the key opens the lock

	! pretty effects
		! tile_key
			! passive: shines nicely
			! collected: explodes in shines

		! tile_lock
			! passive: shines a bit
			! unlocked: drops lock, bounces


=====

GOAL: Conserve RAM, speed up loading.


! Render Rooms only on-screen
	! Test to see if this stresses out the CPU
	! Test if this lags the game at all
! Render Level Editor sprites only on-screen

! fix Level Editor locks not appearing
