tool

BAD


Entities
======

ENTITY(NUT)
=======
! Outside of ENTITIES. Not treated like one.


ENTITIES
=======

! too much faffing in processing
EVERYTHING top-level goes from entities > entity_room > entity

! create and remove are clunky
	! especially remove

! remove has to alter the room's entities
  AND all of the entities behind held
  AND give them new IDs
