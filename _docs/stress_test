	5000
	Class with 15 sub-classes (w/ 10 variables and 2 methods)
	+ empty draw

	5000 Sprites with textures

	5000 Sprites without textures

In conclusion...
* Textures aren't RAM demanding.
* Drawing isn't too CPU demanding.

* Iterating through a 5000-object loop IS CPU demanding.
* Classes with many sub-classes IS RAM demanding.


MySprite suggestions/considerations:
	* OPTIONAL sub-classes. Active only when specified.
	* Be careful about the SCOPE of a loop through sprites.
	* Only remove MySprites if the process is light.
