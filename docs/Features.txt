- Choice of powers
To progress in metroidvanias, you usually need to find a power-granting thingamabob in order to, I dunno, help you climb a wall or something. Hivemind offers a few different powers which do this job, with varying other uses and drawbacks.

(Mix and match them, too!)
Your cool powers may be used with your other cool powers for added coolness.

- Factions
Based on your relations with other factions, their people may help or hinder you. This'll make certain areas a lot more or a lot less dangerous.
