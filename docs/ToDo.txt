Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.

Make an NPC to interact with Nut.
Allow the NPC to provide Nut with an option which activates a flag.
Allow Nut to select an action with an NPC which makes it turn hostile.

=====
x Entities may run with progressive speed.

~ sheet_pos is now sheet_config
Contains Move and Clip.

x Make walk animation.
+ Sprites are flipped when facing another direction.

+ Added vertical and horizontal flipping to MySprite.clip
+ Added Dot to geometry for debugging purposes
+ Added MySprite.slope_collision

~ Ported from pysfml2-cython to pySFML 1.3.
======
+ Loads collision data from a tileset.
Converts the tileset collisions into room collisions.

x Entity collides with any aa tiles.

GOAL: Add slope collisions to the game.
Check collisions tile-per-tile.

* Add collisions for every tile in the slope collisions tilemap.
	* Define these collision types in advance.

		x Filled in all of the collision cells.
			x 1-tile slopes
			* 2-tile slopes
			* 3-tile slopes
-

GOAL: Add 'clip' collisions to Entity.

Problems:
	x FIXED: Nut gets caught in gaps between the tiles.
	(x only checks for overlap, y checks for any collision)

	* Nut jumps strangely.
	
	x FIXED: Hitbox clips against bottom and right
	(top and left of the tile)
		Scan wasn't large enough.

* Fix the messiness of collisions.

* Fix lag issue while moving around the WorldMap.
	* Investigate the stress empty MySprites put on.

* Add a system for assigning collision data to a tilemap.
