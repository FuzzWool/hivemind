===========

Goals:
x Load levels from a file.

A mini world map may determine which 'block' the player is in


0.0.6 - Edited level files shrink.
Goals:
	x CTRL + WASD snaps to nearest 'room'.
	x Level adds filler to -x and -y, moving the level.
	Level de-loads any unnecessary space.
	Level and tiles draws only what's on-screen.
