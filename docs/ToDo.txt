Let there be Levels
===========
Seamless loading from level to level. No transitions.

Goals:
x Load levels from a file.
Append a level to another level from two level files.
Gradually load and de-load levels during exploration.
Append levels based on a world file's data.


0.0.5 - Edited level files widen and shrink.
Goals:
	x CTRL + WASD snaps to nearest 'room'.
	Level de-loads any unnecessary space.
	Level adds filler to -x and -y, moving the level.
	Make grid a part of LevelEditor.

(Expansions should be in Rooms to encourage consistent Level design)

x Make a Grid subclass for the Level Editor
x Grid automatically expands to match the size of the Level

Level only expands as extra rooms, not individual tiles
Special tile marking the start of a new room

Grid Tiles only draw as the camera is focused on them
	Level Tiles too
