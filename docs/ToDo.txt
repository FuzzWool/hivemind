Let there be Levels
===========
Seamless loading from level to level. No transitions.

MAJOR Goals:
x Append a level to another level from two level files.
x Gradually load and de-load levels during exploration.
x Append levels based on a world file's data.
x A mini world map may determine which 'block' the player is in

=
0.0.8 - Multiple levels
Goals:

* Cursor should have coordinates binded to an ELevel. eg: aa
* Different WorldMaps should be binded to individual folders.

x ELevels may be altered individually.
x A WorldMap saves the positioning of all these levels.

-

! Fix TileSelections being limited to a level highlight.
 
! LevelEditor stutters from moving room to room.

- removed static_level from Level
+ Added load_around for Level.

! Only read the tiles needed.
Lag from opening texture file? Test this.
	
	x Load all the tiles for a level.
	x Draw only one.
	Jitters.

	+ Load only what's needed for a level.
	+ Draw all loaded.
	No jitter! Initialization is to blame.
