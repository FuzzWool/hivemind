Let there be Levels
===========

Goals:
x Load levels from a file.
Append a level to another level from two level files.
Gradually load and de-load levels during exploration.
Append levels based on a world file's data.


0.0.5 - Edited level files widen and shrink.
Goals:
	x CTRL + WASD snaps to nearest 'room'.
	Level de-loads any unnecessary space.
	Level adds filler to -x and -y, moving the level.
	Make grid a part of LevelEditor.

x SHIFT + WASD snaps to nearest 'room'.
	x Make an EditorCamera which accomplishes this.
		x get room_x, room_y
		x set room_x, room_y
			setting snaps to both room_x and room_y

-

+ class RoomCamera (inherits from MyCamera)
	gets/sets room_x and room_y

+ LevelEditor may use SHIFT + WASD to snap to a room.
	(using RoomCamera)

~ LevelEditor is now a seperate file.
