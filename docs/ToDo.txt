GOAL: Clean up ROOM and WORLDMAP code.
ROOM and WORLDMAP has become unruly.

Room

* Loading MULTIPLE ROOMS at once.
	Tested CAMERA DRAWING. (No lag! Sheets are loaded already)
	Tested SHEET LOADING. (100 sheets = 2 secs)

! Load TILESHEETS in advance. No redundant loading!
	Loading images is QUICK.
	Loading tile sprites is SLOW.
		! MySprites' extra bulk adds to the wait.

		! Even loading EMPTY TILES is slow.
			First, use empty streamlined MySprites.
			If that doesn't work, make and use IgnoreSprite.

====

! Holding both directional keys causes weird Nut walking.

! Fix lag issue while moving around the WorldMap.
	* Investigate the stress empty MySprites put on.
