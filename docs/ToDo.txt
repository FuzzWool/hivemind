x Drawing
x Try drawing only one column.
	x There's still lag. Not a drawing glitch.

x Initializing
	x One tile for returned data

Checks
	~ WorldMap no longer scans for levels outside of it's boundary. Instead, only adds Rooms based on a boundary.

	~ To remove rooms, WorldMap saves the old boundary and removes any Rooms stored in it which isn't relevant to the new bounds.
