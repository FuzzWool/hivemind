Let there be Levels
===========
Seamless loading from level to level. No transitions.

MAJOR Goals:
x Append a level to another level from two level files.
x Gradually load and de-load levels during exploration.
x Append levels based on a world file's data.
x A mini world map may determine which 'block' the player is in

=
0.0.8 - Multiple levels
Goals:

* Cursor should have coordinates binded to an ELevel. eg: aa
* Different WorldMaps should be binded to individual folders.

x ELevels may be altered individually.
x A WorldMap saves the positioning of all these levels.

-

! Fix TileSelections being limited to a level highlight.
 

+ Increased the tolerance of de-loading. (Adjustable)

~ Level Editor is no longer glitched.
Doesn't draw any levels.

	~ EWorldMap now uses load_all with ELevel.
	~ ELevel no longer renders textures.
	Draws individual tiles and grids instead.

	~ LevelEditor now calls load_around instead of load_all.

	- Removed change_tile from ELevel.

! LevelEditor stutters from moving room to room.
