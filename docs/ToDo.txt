Let there be People
===========
Nut is born, and she has basic controls.
Interaction with NPCs and enemies.

Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.

Allow Nut to run across 1/2-block slopes.

Make an enemy which moves left and right and hits Nut.

Make an NPC to interact with Nut.
Allow the NPC to provide Nut with an option which activates a flag.
Allow Nut to select an action with an NPC which makes it turn hostile.

=====
x Entities may run with progressive speed.

~ sheet_pos is now sheet_config
Contains Move and Clip.

x Make jump animation.
	x Add clipping to sheet_config

-

+ Made a walking animation.

+ Added MySprite.animation.clips and clip_interval

Giving clips a sequence ((x,y),(x,y)) will cause it to swap between those clips endlessly, updating every clip_interval.

May be set once. Interrupted when clip chosen is outside of sequence.


GOAL: Running across 1/2-block slopes.

x Make walk animation.
	x Made a clip cycler within MySprite.animation

		x Fixed: doesn't stop when a new clip is assigned
		Fix this: make a system that flushes the clip

		x Fixed: skipping the first clip

x Consider a more elegant approach to the clip cycler.
	x Only needs to be called once.
	x Sequence breaks only if clip is called outside of the animation.

Look in to running across 1/2-block slopes.
