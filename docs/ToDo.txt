Let there be People
===========
Nut is born, and she has basic controls.
Interaction with NPCs and enemies.

Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.

Allow Nut to run across 1/2-block slopes.

Make an enemy which moves left and right and hits Nut.

Make an NPC to interact with Nut.
Allow the NPC to provide Nut with an option which activates a flag.
Allow Nut to select an action with an NPC which makes it turn hostile.

=====
x Entities may run with progressive speed.

~ sheet_pos is now sheet_config
Contains Move and Clip.

x Make jump animation.
x Make walk animation.
+ Sprites are flipped when facing another direction.

+ Added vertical and horizontal flipping to MySprite.clip
+ Added Dot to geometry for debugging purposes
+ Added MySprite.slope_collision

~ Ported from pysfml2-cython to pySFML 1.3.
======
+ Loads collision data from a tileset.
Converts the tileset collisions into room collisions.

x Entity collides with any aa tiles.

GOAL: Add slope collisions to the game.
Check collisions tile-per-tile.

* Add collisions for every tile in the slope collisions tilemap.
	* Define these collision types in advance.

		x Filled in all of the collision cells.
			x 1-tile slopes
			* 2-tile slopes
			* 3-tile slopes


GOAL: Fix 2-tile slopes.

* STATES weren't responding correctly for 2-TILE-SLOPES
fix: changed state handling to convert floats to ints

* 2-TILE-SLOPES collisions cause ENTITY to LEVITATE
fix: swapped a and b around in room

	* LEVITATED over the left-SLOPE tile.
	fix: states now check for the slope points instead of the rect points

		! ENTITY clips into the GAP between 2-SLOPE TILES
		x/y tile selection doesn't check for the right tile


-
	! Core collision still pushes sprites out in the wrong direction if at the EDGE of a tile. (for blocks)

-

* Fix the messiness of collisions.
Namely: tx/ty

! Holding both directional keys causes weird Nut walking.

! Fix lag issue while moving around the WorldMap.
	* Investigate the stress empty MySprites put on.

! Add a system for assigning collision data to a tilemap.

! Center Nut's sprite properly within her cbox.
