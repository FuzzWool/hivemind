Let there be Levels
===========
Seamless loading from level to level. No transitions.

MAJOR Goals:
* Append a level to another level from two level files.
* Gradually load and de-load levels during exploration.
* Append levels based on a world file's data.
* A mini world map may determine which 'block' the player is in

=
0.0.8 - Multiple levels
Goals:
* Ctrl+O opens a new Level.
* A WorldMap saves the positioning of all these levels.

* Cursor should have coordinates binded to an ELevel.
* ELevels may be altered individually.

* Draw only tiles (and grids) which're on-screen.
