~ Ported from pysfml2-cython to pySFML 1.3.
======

GOAL: Add slope collisions to the game.
Check collisions tile-per-tile.

* Add collisions for every tile in the slope collisions tilemap.
	* Define these collision types in advance.

		x Filled in all of the collision cells.
			x 1-tile slopes
			* 2-tile slopes
			* 3-tile slopes

~ Fix for: ENTITY can JUMP through BOTTOM of CONNECTED TILES. 
Changed the value for is_x and is_y.


SLOPE bugs
! When JUMPING to the side of a SLOPE, the ENTITY locks on TOP
! Can't JUMP while going LEFT on TOP of a SLOPE.

-

! Slopes 'leading' to the ground cause the entity to spaz.

-

! Holding both directional keys causes weird Nut walking.

! Fix lag issue while moving around the WorldMap.
	* Investigate the stress empty MySprites put on.

! Add a system for assigning collision data to a tilemap.

! Center Nut's sprite properly within her cbox.
