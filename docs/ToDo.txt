Let there be Levels
===========
Seamless loading from level to level. No transitions.

MAJOR Goals:
* Append a level to another level from two level files.
* Gradually load and de-load levels during exploration.
* Append levels based on a world file's data.
* A mini world map may determine which 'block' the player is in


0.0.6 - Toolbox
Goals:
* Add a toolbox menu with multiple, fillable slots.
* Create two tools: cursor and tile.
	Cursor doesn't do anything.
	Tile places down tiles.

x Create toolbox menu on the left.
	x Create toolbox class.
	x Render a box.
	x Render the empty tool slots.

========
0.0.7 - Level Properties

	Properties may:
		Manually define the x/y and w/h of the level
		(in tiles AND rooms)

	* Draw only tiles (and grids) which're on-screen.
	* Special tile marking the start of a new room.
