Let there be Levels
===========
Seamless loading from level to level. No transitions.

Goals:
x Load levels from a file.
Append a level to another level from two level files.
Gradually load and de-load levels during exploration.
Append levels based on a world file's data.


0.0.5 - Edited level files widen and shrink.
Goals:
	CTRL + WASD snaps to nearest 'room'.
	Level de-loads any unnecessary space.
	Level adds filler to -x and -y, moving the level.


x Create a new MyCamera class which inherits from sf.View
	x Test inheritance from Camera to Camera
		x When window becomes Camera B from A
			x Camera window snaps to Camera B's x/y x
			x Camera window snaps to Camera B's zoom x

x Add the new MyCamera to the current code.

Fix MyMouse screwing up with the new Camera.
	window.view refuses to become Camera. Fix.

CTRL + WASD snaps to nearest 'room'.
	Make an EditorCamera which accomplishes this.
		EditorCamera must replace the current Camera instance

		Rounds up to find the nearest room to snap to.
		Snap to Render w and h

-

! There is no longer a global Camera instance.
  Now, Views should be applied over with Cameras.

~ MyCamera now inherits directly from sf.View
+ EditMouse (~ EditMouse)
	Can be forwarded a MyCamera to Position
*LevelEditor
	Now requires a MyCamera for it's Mouse positioning.
