GOAL: Add collisions to the game.
Check collisions tile-per-tile.

x Add slope collisions.

* Add collisions for every tile in the slope collisions tilemap.
	A clean way to apply collision settings to a tile.

	1! In order for a tile to be collidable, it has to have an existing sprite.
		! Off-screen NPCs cannot collide with anything.


1! Make a tile class with...
	x change data (cell) to tile.data
	x change tile (cell) to tile.sprite
	x change collision.data to tile.collision

	* Fix for LevelEditor.

	Modes:
	* Active: Draw, collide. 
	* Passive: Don't draw, collide.
	* Remove: Don't draw, Don't collide.


* Fix side detection faults.
