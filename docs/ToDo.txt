=====
- Removed mo dependancies from Level.
+ Added Level subclass collisions.

GOAL: Collision Detection.

x Make an entity.
x Add gravity to entity.
x Make cbox and center it.

x Work out if two sprites are overlapping.
	x Eject from where it came from
		x Using the smallest offset

+ Level.collision.compounds (for tile collision checks)
It compounds all of the collidable tiles together into the same object.
For all tiles in the compound, it references the compound object.
To use this compound with intended results, do not re-use any references of the same memory.
(Data is contained in all tiles so the information may be accessed anywhere, but can be filtered to only be checked once)

aa tiles in Level are collidable with entities.
	
	when the level is loaded...
		make compound boxes
		return the sizes of these boxes

		!remember to all references so they aren't re-checked

	for every loop...
		Level contains all collisions
		Stored in x, y format
		Located all in occupied spaces in x, y
			Only checks once
