Let there be Levels
===========
Seamless loading from level to level. No transitions.

MAJOR Goals:
* Append a level to another level from two level files.
* Gradually load and de-load levels during exploration.
* Append levels based on a world file's data.
* A mini world map may determine which 'block' the player is in

0.0.7 - Level Properties
Goals:
	* GUI feature: the top-left of a level contains properties.
	Properties may:
		Manually define the x/y and w/h of the level
		(in tiles AND rooms)*

	*Requires a custom window to be built which accepts text input.

	* Draw only tiles (and grids) which're on-screen.
	* Special tile marking the start of a new room.

=

x Make a GUI with x, y, w and h.
x Upon closing the window, print the new values.
Open in the Level Editor.
	x Keep running the LevelEditor when there is no window.

Wrap code in it's own module.

The values given to the properties match the Level's size.
Saved values modify the level's size.



- LevelEditor no longer stores Mouse.
+ Added class LevelProperties.
! Requires special and messy Tkinter handling.

0.0.8 - Level tool
Goals:

* ELevels may be altered individually.
