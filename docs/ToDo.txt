Let there be People
===========
Nut is born, and she has basic controls.
Interaction with NPCs and enemies.

Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.

Allow Nut to run across 1/2-block slopes.

Make an enemy which moves left and right and hits Nut.

Make an NPC to interact with Nut.
Allow the NPC to provide Nut with an option which activates a flag.
Allow Nut to select an action with an NPC which makes it turn hostile.

=====
x Entities may run with progressive speed.

~ sheet_pos is now sheet_config
Contains Move and Clip.

x Make jump animation.
x Make walk animation.
+ Sprites are flipped when facing another direction.

+ Added vertical and horizontal flipping to MySprite.clip
+ Added Dot to geometry for debugging purposes
+ Added MySprite.slope_collision

~ Ported from pysfml2-cython to pySFML 1.3.
======
+ Loads collision data from a tileset.
Converts the tileset collisions into room collisions.

x Entity collides with any aa tiles.

GOAL: Add slope collisions to the game.
Check collisions tile-per-tile.

* Add collisions for every tile in the slope collisions tilemap.
	* Define these collision types in advance.

		x Filled in all of the collision cells.
			x 1-tile slopes
			* 2-tile slopes
			* 3-tile slopes
-

GOAL: Add 'clip' collisions to Entity.

Problems:
	x FIXED: Nut gets caught in gaps between the tiles.
	(x only checks for overlap, y checks for any collision)

	x FIXED: Nut jumps strangely.
	(move is confirmed right after pushback and before checks)
	
	x FIXED: Hitbox clips against bottom and right
	(top and left of the tile)
		Scan wasn't large enough.

	* When jumping and landing, Nut gets pushed away from the gap of a tile.
		* Make a PRUNING system which grabs only the tiles closest to x and y.
			! GRAPHICAL DEBUGGING

! Colour all tiles nearby to the player.

* Fix the messiness of collisions.

! Holding both directional keys causes weird Nut walking.

* Fix lag issue while moving around the WorldMap.
	* Investigate the stress empty MySprites put on.

* Add a system for assigning collision data to a tilemap.
