Let there be People
===========
Nut is born, and she has basic controls.
Interaction with NPCs and enemies.

Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.

Allow Nut to run across 1/2-block slopes.

Make an enemy which moves left and right and hits Nut.

Make an NPC to interact with Nut.
Allow the NPC to provide Nut with an option which activates a flag.
Allow Nut to select an action with an NPC which makes it turn hostile.

=====
x Entities may run with progressive speed.

~ sheet_pos is now sheet_config
Contains Move and Clip.

x Make jump animation.
x Make walk animation.
+ Sprites are flipped when facing another direction.

+ Added vertical and horizontal flipping to MySprite.clip
+ Added Dot to geometry for debugging purposes
+ Added MySprite.slope_collision

~ Ported from pysfml2-cython to pySFML 1.3.
======
+ Loads collision data from a tileset.
Converts the tileset collisions into room collisions.

x Entity collides with any aa tiles.
=

GOAL: Add slope collisions to the game.
Check collisions tile-per-tile.

* Add collisions for every tile in the slope collisions tilemap.
	* Define these collision types in advance.

		x Filled in all of the collision cells.
			x 1-tile slopes
			x 2-tile slopes
			x upper 2-tile slopes
-

* GOAL: Test ALL sloped tiles again. Look for any bugs.

* tiles
* 1-tile slopes
* 2-tile hori
* 2-tile vert


Strengths/Weaknesses
=
+ Slopes are tile-by-tile, and are consistant in code.
	+ Slopes can fluidly lead from one to another.
	+ Slopes can handle an intersection from any 'chunk' of the tile.

- Upward Slopes
	- Entity attempts to move up upward slopes, and gets jammed in the center.
	- Entity cannot snap to upward slopes.

- Slopes leading downwards
	- Entities may be lead downwards into the ground, causing them to SPAZ EVERYWHERE in an attempt to find a safe place.
		* Suggested fix: Collisions also compare against OTHER collisions to check that their pushback doesn't overlap with them.

CONSIDERATIONS
=

Pushback Prediction
-
* Single-place check ejections are messy, and cannot accurately pushback
Collisions NEVER physically overlap with each other.
Movements which result in a collision are cut back.
* Prior and post checks allow a collision to work out where to pushback


Pushback Priorities
-
* Pushbacks putting the collidable into small gaps causes it to spaz.
It has no sense of priority compared to other objects.


Slope Chunks
-
* Be VERY careful about the differences of the SLOPE and the ENTIRETY.
There have been numerous issues in coding based around using the wrong sizing for calculation
Particularly:
pushback for the hypotenuse: uses SLOPE sizing.
prioritizing distance:		 uses ENTIRE sizing.



---

! Holding both directional keys causes weird Nut walking.

! Fix lag issue while moving around the WorldMap.
	* Investigate the stress empty MySprites put on.

! Add a system for assigning collision data to a tilemap.

! Center Nut's sprite properly within her cbox.
