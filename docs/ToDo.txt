Let there be People
===========
Nut is born, and she has basic controls.
Interaction with NPCs and enemies.

Goals:
x Make Nut with basic left and right controls.

Allow Nut to run across 1/2-block slopes.

Make an enemy which moves left and right and hits Nut.

Make an NPC to interact with Nut.
Allow the NPC to provide Nut with an option which activates a flag.
Allow Nut to select an action with an NPC which makes it turn hostile.

=====
x Entities may run with progressive speed.

~ sheet_pos is now sheet_config
Contains Move and Clip.

x Make jump animation.
x Make walk animation.
+ Sprites are flipped when facing another direction.


-
+ Added vertical and horizontal flipping to MySprite.clip
+ Added Dot to geometry for debugging purposes


GOAL: Running across 1/2-block slopes.

Using the Seperating Axis Theorem.
	* Make a new collision check for triangular objects.
	* Draw the projection of the check.
-


! Transition is unclean, it doesn't matter, because:
* Arbitary x is always far enough away from the check, so the transition never makes contact.

x Make a third SAT test.

x Test that the Z-axis can handle being given different angles.
	x Create...
		x Coordinates.
		x Lengths.
		x Angles.

	x Create a quick way to test all four triangle types.
	
	x Make lines connecting to the z-points.
		x Convert points in to objects.

		x Works for 'changed points'. (Points not binded to a side)

	x Make z1 and z2 and their line.
		x Test with every anchor.


Make collision push-back.

	! ru Bug: When the projected corner of the rect intersects with c, it bounces rapidly
	
		Work out collisions in advance
